Notes:

If a number was up at the top right of the image it would be focussed on inputs that were not usually involved. Should there be automated scaling of the inputs prior to 
processing?

Is it allowed to manipulate the image before feeding it to the neural network? 

Remember when summing inputs from links it could be happening in different threads. Use lock or other helper to increment double.
